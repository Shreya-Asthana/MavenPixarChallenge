# Disney Pixar Movie Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Disney Pixar movies using Power BI. The dataset consists of seven tables containing various details such as genres, ratings, box office collections, awards, and other relevant movie-related information. The goal of this project is to gain meaningful insights from the data by building a structured data model, performing necessary transformations, and visualizing key metrics through a Power BI dashboard.

## Data Processing & Transformation

- **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between seven tables based on relevant keys to ensure seamless data integration.

- **Data Cleaning:** Performed necessary transformations to enhance data quality.

- **Column Adjustments:** Modified column headers for consistency and clarity.

- **Data Type Conversion:** Converted textual numerical columns to decimal numbers using the VALUE function in DAX to facilitate mathematical computations.

## Key Insights & Visualizations

The final dashboard provides the following insights:

- Top 5 Movies with Most Award Wins
